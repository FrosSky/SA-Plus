## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No, we will not engage in any actions that are harmful or dangerous and we ensure everyone is safe.

**Q: Is this website official?**

**A:** Yes, any website claiming to represent us or providing downloads claiming to come from us is not legitimate.

**Q: Why was multi-instance launching removed?**

**A:** It was removed starting with v2.6.0 for the [reasons stated here](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Plans-to-remove-multi%E2%80%90instance-launching-from-Bloxstrap). It may be added back in the future when there are less issues with doing so.

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Alternatively, you can install Bloxstrap via [Winget](https://winstall.app/apps/pizzaboxer.Bloxstrap) by running this in a Command Prompt window:
```
> winget install bloxstrap
```

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.
